_**How did the idea for the company (or project) come about?**_

* The idea for the company came about around 2017 when there were really no easy solutions for self-custody fiat on ramps in crypto.* In order to fund or top up your wallet, users were required to go through centralized exchanges to buy their crytpto, from which they would then need to transfer it to their respective wallet. CEX's often had KYC limitations or holds put on users funds before you were able to transfer them out
* The inital product created was originally a non-custodial wallet that enabled you to purchase crypto directly inside of it without the need of a centralized exchange
* From there the true birth of moonpay came about when a partnership with bitcoin.com led to moonpay integrating their infrstructure in bitcoin.com's wallet, positioning moonpay to become one of the leading B2B2C crypto infrastructure solutions.

_**How is the company funded? How much funding have they received?**_

* Moonpay has raised a total of 650.7M in funding over 8 rounds, with a valuation of $3.4B Institutional investors include Tifer Global Management, Coatue, and New Enterprise Associates.

## Business Activities

_**What specific financial problem is the company or project trying to solve?**_

* MoonPay tackles the issue of simplifying the exchange of fiat money (like dollars or euros) into cryptocurrencies. Traditionally, this process required navigating complex systems, complying with regulations, and forming secure financial partnerships. MoonPay's solution streamlines this, making it more accessible for individuals and businesses to enter the cryptocurrency market without facing these complexities. This approach aims to broaden the use of cryptocurrencies by making them more user-friendly and easier to acquire.

_**Who is the company's intended customer?  Is there any information about the market size of this set of customers?**_

* MoonPay serves four primary customer groups. Initially, it targets individual consumers by providing a wallet and mobile app designed for buying and selling cryptocurrencies. Additionally, the company offers its crypto on-and-off ramp infrastructure and NFT checkout service to businesses like Bitcoin.com and BRD. MoonPay has also expanded its services to high-net-worth individuals and well-known figures with the launch of MoonPay Concierge. Finally, it caters to creators and entrepreneurs looking to launch web3 products by offering them HyperMint, a specialized platform.
* Originally, MoonPay focused on web3 users with its crypto payments platform, catering to a specific but growing part of the digital market. However, with new products like HyperMint for NFTs and MoonPay Concierge for marketing, the company has greatly expanded its reach. These new offerings have allowed MoonPay to move beyond just web3 users to a much larger audience in the Creator & Internet Economy. This expansion has grown MoonPay's market from initially serving 300 million users in a $1.2 trillion crypto market to now reaching a massive global audience of 4.7 billion people.

_**What solution does this company offer that their competitor(What is the unfair advantage they utilize?)**_
  
* Moonpay simplifies the process of converting fiat to crypto and digital goods, eliminating the need for businesses to invest in complex infrastructure, establish relationships with financial institutions, and ensure regulatory compliance. Their comprehensive and adaptable APIs and SDKs enable easy integration into existing systems, allowing businesses and developers to focus on their core operations. Moonpay's solutions offer extensive customization to align with specific brand or application requirements.
